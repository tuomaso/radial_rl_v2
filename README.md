# Robust Adversarial Loss(RADIAL) - RL
This repository will contain all code and models used for our NeurIPS 2021 publication "Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning through Adversarial Loss". 

An earlier version of our work is available at github.com/tuomaso/radial_rl, which corresponds to Approach #1 for Atari DQN and A3C of our expanded work.
